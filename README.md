# Real-time-neural-style-transfer

The project is based on real time conversion of images from webcam, to artistic style of paintings using deep neural networks.
The inspiration for artistic neural stlye transfer comes from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576 by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge, while the code derives heavily from the implementation of Adrian Rosebrock for the same.

To run the code, execute the command: python main.py --models models

To change the style: press N

To take a snap: press C
(the output window size and its location on the screen may vary over different machines. It is required to adjust these in case the output is not as expected.)

To quit the window: press Q
